# Lyrix 🚀

This is an IOS extension I have been building on the side that helps people communicate their feelings through an artist's lyrics. 
## 🛠️ Tools Used

- [Swift]: Native IOS development for iMessage Extensions

- [Cohere]: A powerful AI tool creating the vector embeddings for each lyric

- [Python]: Used to train data and make the embeddings and queries to the DB

- [Pinecone]: Vector DB Used to store embeddings produced by Cohere



### ❓ What & Why

This is something I am creating because I found that there were often times in groupchats that I am a part of friends would use rapper / artist quotes to communicate their feelings and I figured that it would be super useful to create a search engine to create these on the fly, as opposed to stoing screenshots of lyrics in a album.
